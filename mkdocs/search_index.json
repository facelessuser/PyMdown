            "text": "Markdown Syntax\n\n\nMark Gruber\ns Markdown syntax.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThis documentation lays out the syntax of Mark Gruber\ns Markdown specifications.  It is taken from his \nsite\n.  The content and info is his words, but it is here for convenience.\n\n\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nPhilosophy\n\n\nMarkdown is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as is feasible.\n\n\nReadability, however, is emphasized above all else. A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it\ns been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While Markdown\ns syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters \n including \nSetext\n, \natx\n, \nTextile\n, \nreStructuredText\n,\n\n\nGrutatext\n, and \nEtText\n \n the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown\ns syntax is the format of plain text email.\n\n\nTo this end, Markdown\ns syntax is comprised entirely of punctuation characters, which punctuation characters have been carefully chosen so as to look like what they mean. E.g., asterisks around a word actually look like *emphasis*. Markdown lists look like, well, lists. Even blockquotes look like quoted passages of text, assuming you\nve ever used email.\n\n\nInline HTML\n\n\nMarkdown\ns syntax is intended for one purpose: to be used as a format for \nwriting\n for the web.\n\n\nMarkdown is not a replacement for HTML, or even close to it. Its syntax is very small, corresponding only to a very small subset of HTML tags. The idea is \nnot\n to create a syntax that makes it easier to insert HTML tags. In my opinion, HTML tags are already easy to insert. The idea for Markdown is to make it easy to read, write, and edit prose. HTML is a \npublishing\n format; Markdown is a \nwriting\n format. Thus, Markdown\ns formatting syntax only addresses issues that can be conveyed in plain text.\n\n\nFor any markup that is not covered by Markdown\ns syntax, you simply use HTML itself. There\ns no need to preface it or delimit it to indicate that you\nre switching from Markdown to HTML; you just use the tags.\n\n\nThe only restrictions are that block-level HTML elements \n e.g. \ndiv\n, \ntable\n, \npre\n, \np\n, etc. \n must be separated from surrounding content by blank lines, and the start and end tags of the block should not be indented with tabs or spaces. Markdown is smart enough not to add extra (unwanted) \np\n tags around HTML block-level tags.\n\n\nFor example, to add an HTML table to a Markdown article:\n\n\nThis is a regular paragraph.\n\n\ntable\n\n    \ntr\n\n        \ntd\nFoo\n/td\n\n    \n/tr\n\n\n/table\n\n\nThis is another regular paragraph.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that Markdown formatting syntax is not processed within block-level HTML tags. E.g., you can\nt use Markdown-style \n*emphasis*\n inside an HTML block.\n\n\nSpan-level HTML tags \n e.g. \nspan\n, \ncite\n, or \ndel\n \n can be used anywhere in a Markdown paragraph, list item, or header. If you want, you can even use HTML tags instead of Markdown formatting; e.g. if you\nd prefer to use HTML \na\n or \nimg\n tags instead of Markdown\ns link or image syntax, go right ahead.\n\n\nUnlike block-level HTML tags, Markdown syntax \nis\n processed within span-level tags.\n\n\nAutomatic Escaping for Special Characters\n\n\nIn HTML, there are two characters that demand special treatment: \n and \n. Left angle brackets are used to start tags; ampersands are used to denote HTML entities. If you want to use them as literal characters, you must escape them as entities, e.g. \nlt;\n, and \namp;\n.\n\n\nAmpersands in particular are bedeviling for web writers. If you want to write about \nAT\nT\n, you need to write \nAT\namp;T\n. You even need to escape ampersands within URLs. Thus, if you want to link to:\n\n\nhttp://images.google.com/images?num=30\nq=larry+bird\n\n\n\n\n\nyou need to encode the URL as:\n\n\nhttp://images.google.com/images?num=30\namp;q=larry+bird\n\n\n\n\n\nin your anchor tag \nhref\n attribute. Needless to say, this is easy to forget, and is probably the single most common source of HTML validation errors in otherwise well-marked-up web sites.\n\n\nMarkdown allows you to use these characters naturally, taking care of all the necessary escaping for you. If you use an ampersand as part of an HTML entity, it remains unchanged; otherwise it will be translated into \namp;\n.\n\n\nSo, if you want to include a copyright symbol in your article, you can write:\n\n\ncopy;\n\n\n\n\n\nand Markdown will leave it alone. But if you write:\n\n\nAT\nT\n\n\n\n\n\nMarkdown will translate it to:\n\n\nAT\namp;T\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, because Markdown supports \ninline HTML\n, if you use angle brackets as delimiters for HTML tags, Markdown will treat them as such. But if you write:\n\n\n4 \n 5\n\n\n\n\n\nMarkdown will translate it to:\n\n\n4 \nlt; 5\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, inside Markdown code spans and blocks, angle brackets and ampersands are \nalways\n encoded automatically. This makes it easy to use Markdown to write about HTML code. (As opposed to raw HTML, which is a terrible format for writing about HTML syntax, because every single \n and \n in your example code needs to be escaped.)\n\n\n\n\nBlock Elements\n\n\nParagraphs and Line Breaks\n\n\nA paragraph is simply one or more consecutive lines of text, separated by one or more blank lines. (A blank line is any line that looks like a blank line \n a line containing nothing but spaces or tabs is considered blank.) Normal paragraphs should not be indented with spaces or tabs.\n\n\nThe implication of the \none or more consecutive lines of text\n rule is that Markdown supports \nhard-wrapped\n text paragraphs. This differs significantly from most other text-to-HTML formatters (including Movable Type\ns \nConvert Line Breaks\n option) which translate every line break character in a paragraph into a \nbr /\n tag.\n\n\nWhen you \ndo\n want to insert a \nbr /\n break tag using Markdown, you end a line with two or more spaces, then type return.\n\n\nYes, this takes a tad more effort to create a \nbr /\n, but a simplistic \nevery line break is a \nbr /\n rule wouldn\nt work for Markdown. Markdown\ns email-style \nblockquoting\n and multi-paragraph \nlist items\n work best \n and look better \n when you format them with hard breaks.\n\n\nHeaders\n\n\nMarkdown supports two styles of headers, \nSetext\n and \natx\n.\n\n\nSetext-style headers are \nunderlined\n using equal signs (for first-level headers) and dashes (for second-level headers). For example:\n\n\nThis is an H1\n=============\n\nThis is an H2\n-------------\n\n\n\n\n\nAny number of underlining \n=\ns or \n-\ns will work.\n\n\nAtx-style headers use 1-6 hash characters at the start of the line, corresponding to header levels 1-6. For example:\n\n\n# This is an H1\n\n## This is an H2\n\n###### This is an H6\n\n\n\n\n\nOptionally, you may \nclose\n atx-style headers. This is purely cosmetic \n you can use this if you think it looks better. The closing hashes don\nt even need to match the number of hashes used to open the header. (The number of opening hashes determines the header level.) :\n\n\n# This is an H1 #\n\n## This is an H2 ##\n\n### This is an H3 ######\n\n\n\n\n\nBlockquotes\n\n\nMarkdown uses email-style \n characters for blockquoting. If you\nre familiar with quoting passages of text in an email message, then you know how to create a blockquote in Markdown. It looks best if you hard wrap the text and put a \n before every line:\n\n\n This is a blockquote with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus. Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus.\n\n \n\n Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit. Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.\n\n\n\n\n\nMarkdown allows you to be lazy and only put the \n before the first line of a hard-wrapped paragraph:\n\n\n This is a blockquote with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus. Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus.\n\n\n Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit. Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.\n\n\n\n\n\nBlockquotes can be nested (i.e. a blockquote-in-a-blockquote) by adding additional levels of \n:\n\n\n This is the first level of quoting.\n\n\n\n \n This is nested blockquote.\n\n\n\n Back to the first level.\n\n\n\n\n\nBlockquotes can contain other Markdown elements, including headers, lists, and code blocks:\n\n\n ## This is a header.\n\n \n\n 1.   This is the first list item.\n\n 2.   This is the second list item.\n\n \n\n Here\ns some example code:\n\n \n\n     return shell_exec(\necho $input | $markdown_script\n);\n\n\n\n\n\nAny decent text editor should make email-style quoting easy. For example, with BBEdit, you can make a selection and choose Increase Quote Level from the Text menu.\n\n\nLists\n\n\nMarkdown supports ordered (numbered) and unordered (bulleted) lists.\n\n\nUnordered lists use asterisks, pluses, and hyphens \n interchangably\n\n\n as list markers:\n\n\n*   Red\n*   Green\n*   Blue\n\n\n\n\n\nis equivalent to:\n\n\n+   Red\n+   Green\n+   Blue\n\n\n\n\n\nand:\n\n\n-   Red\n-   Green\n-   Blue\n\n\n\n\n\nOrdered lists use numbers followed by periods:\n\n\n1.  Bird\n2.  McHale\n3.  Parish\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\ns important to note that the actual numbers you use to mark the list have no effect on the HTML output Markdown produces. The HTML Markdown produces from the above list is:\n\n\nol\n\n\nli\nBird\n/li\n\n\nli\nMcHale\n/li\n\n\nli\nParish\n/li\n\n\n/ol\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you instead wrote the list in Markdown like this:\n\n\n1.  Bird\n1.  McHale\n1.  Parish\n\n\n\n\n\nor even:\n\n\n3. Bird\n1. McHale\n8. Parish\n\n\n\n\n\nyou\nd get the exact same HTML output. The point is, if you want to, you can use ordinal numbers in your ordered Markdown lists, so that the numbers in your source match the numbers in your published HTML. But if you want to be lazy, you don\nt have to.\n\n\nIf you do use lazy list numbering, however, you should still start the list with the number 1. At some point in the future, Markdown may support starting ordered lists at an arbitrary number.\n\n\nList markers typically start at the left margin, but may be indented by up to three spaces. List markers must be followed by one or more spaces or a tab.\n\n\nTo make lists look nice, you can wrap items with hanging indents:\n\n\n*   Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus. Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus.\n*   Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit. Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut if you want to be lazy, you don\nt have to:\n\n\n*   Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus. Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus.\n*   Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit. Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf list items are separated by blank lines, Markdown will wrap the\n\nitems in \np\n tags in the HTML output. For example, this input:\n\n\n*   Bird\n*   Magic\n\n\n\n\n\nwill turn into:\n\n\nul\n\n\nli\nBird\n/li\n\n\nli\nMagic\n/li\n\n\n/ul\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut this:\n\n\n*   Bird\n\n*   Magic\n\n\n\n\n\nwill turn into:\n\n\nul\n\n\nli\np\nBird\n/p\n/li\n\n\nli\np\nMagic\n/p\n/li\n\n\n/ul\n\n\n\n\n\n\nList items may consist of multiple paragraphs. Each subsequent paragraph in a list item must be indented by either 4 spaces or one tab:\n\n\n1.  This is a list item with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus.\n\n    Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus. Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit.\n\n2.  Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt looks nice if you indent every line of the subsequent paragraphs, but here again, Markdown will allow you to be lazy:\n\n\n*   This is a list item with two paragraphs.\n\n    This is the second paragraph in the list item. You\nre only required to indent the first line. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.\n\n*   Another item in the same list.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo put a blockquote within a list item, the blockquote\ns \n delimiters need to be indented:\n\n\n*   A list item with a blockquote:\n\n    \n This is a blockquote\n    \n inside a list item.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo put a code block within a list item, the code block needs to be indented \ntwice\n \n 8 spaces or two tabs:\n\n\n*   A list item with a code block:\n\n        \ncode goes here\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\ns worth noting that it\ns possible to trigger an ordered list by accident, by writing something like this:\n\n\n1986. What a great season.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn other words, a \nnumber-period-space\n sequence at the beginning of a line. To avoid this, you can backslash-escape the period:\n\n\n1986\\. What a great season.\n\n\n\n\n\nCode Blocks\n\n\nPre-formatted code blocks are used for writing about programming or markup source code. Rather than forming normal paragraphs, the lines of a code block are interpreted literally. Markdown wraps a code block in both \npre\n and \ncode\n tags.\n\n\nTo produce a code block in Markdown, simply indent every line of the block by at least 4 spaces or 1 tab. For example, given this input:\n\n\nThis is a normal paragraph:\n\n    This is a code block.\n\n\n\n\n\nMarkdown will generate:\n\n\np\nThis is a normal paragraph:\n/p\n\n\n\npre\ncode\nThis is a code block.\n\n/code\n/pre\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne level of indentation \n 4 spaces or 1 tab \n is removed from each line of the code block. For example, this:\n\n\nHere is an example of AppleScript:\n\n    tell application \nFoo\n\n        beep\n    end tell\n\n\n\n\n\nwill turn into:\n\n\np\nHere is an example of AppleScript:\n/p\n\n\n\npre\ncode\ntell application \nFoo\n\n    beep\nend tell\n\n/code\n/pre\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA code block continues until it reaches a line that is not indented (or the end of the article).\n\n\nWithin a code block, ampersands (\n) and angle brackets (\n and \n) are automatically converted into HTML entities. This makes it very easy to include example HTML source code using Markdown \n just paste it and indent it, and Markdown will handle the hassle of encoding the ampersands and angle brackets. For example, this:\n\n\n    \ndiv class=\nfooter\n\n        \ncopy; 2004 Foo Corporation\n    \n/div\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwill turn into:\n\n\npre\ncode\nlt;div class=\nfooter\ngt;\n    \namp;copy; 2004 Foo Corporation\n\nlt;/div\ngt;\n\n/code\n/pre\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegular Markdown syntax is not processed within code blocks. E.g., asterisks are just literal asterisks within a code block. This means it\ns also easy to use Markdown to write about Markdown\ns own syntax.\n\n\nHorizontal Rules\n\n\nYou can produce a horizontal rule tag (\nhr /\n) by placing three or more hyphens, asterisks, or underscores on a line by themselves. If you wish, you may use spaces between the hyphens or asterisks. Each of the following lines will produce a horizontal rule:\n\n\n* * *\n\n***\n\n*****\n\n- - -\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpan Elements\n\n\nLinks\n\n\nMarkdown supports two style of links: \ninline\n and \nreference\n.\n\n\nIn both styles, the link text is delimited by [square brackets].\n\n\nTo create an inline link, use a set of regular parentheses immediately after the link text\ns closing square bracket. Inside the parentheses, put the URL where you want the link to point, along with an \noptional\n title for the link, surrounded in quotes. For example:\n\n\nThis is [an example](http://example.com/ \nTitle\n) inline link.\n\n[This link](http://example.net/) has no title attribute.\n\n\n\n\n\nWill produce:\n\n\np\nThis is \na href=\nhttp://example.com/\n title=\nTitle\n\nan example\n/a\n inline link.\n/p\n\n\n\np\na href=\nhttp://example.net/\nThis link\n/a\n has no\ntitle attribute.\n/p\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\nre referring to a local resource on the same server, you can use relative paths:\n\n\nSee my [About](/about/) page for details.\n\n\n\n\n\nReference-style links use a second set of square brackets, inside which you place a label of your choosing to identify the link:\n\n\nThis is [an example][id] reference-style link.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can optionally use a space to separate the sets of brackets:\n\n\nThis is [an example] [id] reference-style link.\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, anywhere in the document, you define your link label like this, on a line by itself:\n\n\n[id]: http://example.com/  \nOptional Title Here\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat is:\n\n\n\n\nSquare brackets containing the link identifier (optionally indented from the left margin using up to three spaces);\n\n\nfollowed by a colon;\n\n\nfollowed by one or more spaces (or tabs);\n\n\nfollowed by the URL for the link;\n\n\noptionally followed by a title attribute for the link, enclosed in double or single quotes, or enclosed in parentheses.\n\n\n\n\nThe following three link definitions are equivalent:\n\n\n[foo]: http://example.com/  \nOptional Title Here\n\n[foo]: http://example.com/  \nOptional Title Here\n\n[foo]: http://example.com/  (Optional Title Here)\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n There is a known bug in Markdown.pl 1.0.1 which prevents single quotes from being used to delimit link titles.\n\n\nThe link URL may, optionally, be surrounded by angle brackets:\n\n\n[id]: \nhttp://example.com/\n  \nOptional Title Here\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can put the title attribute on the next line and use extra spaces or tabs for padding, which tends to look better with longer URLs:\n\n\n[id]: http://example.com/longish/path/to/resource/here\n    \nOptional Title Here\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLink definitions are only used for creating links during Markdown processing, and are stripped from your document in the HTML output.\n\n\nLink definition names may consist of letters, numbers, spaces, and punctuation \n but they are \nnot\n case sensitive. E.g. these two links:\n\n\n[link text][a]\n[link text][A]\n\n\n\n\n\nare equivalent.\n\n\nThe \nimplicit link name\n shortcut allows you to omit the name of the link, in which case the link text itself is used as the name. Just use an empty set of square brackets \n e.g., to link the word \nGoogle\n to the google.com web site, you could simply write:\n\n\n[Google][]\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd then define the link:\n\n\n[Google]: http://google.com/\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause link names may contain spaces, this shortcut even works for multiple words in the link text:\n\n\nVisit [Daring Fireball][] for more information.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd then define the link:\n\n\n[Daring Fireball]: http://daringfireball.net/\n\n\n\n\n\nLink definitions can be placed anywhere in your Markdown document. I tend to put them immediately after each paragraph in which they\nre used, but if you want, you can put them all at the end of your document, sort of like footnotes.\n\n\nHere\ns an example of reference links in action:\n\n\nI get 10 times more traffic from [Google] [1] than from\n[Yahoo] [2] or [MSN] [3].\n\n  [1]: http://google.com/        \nGoogle\n\n  [2]: http://search.yahoo.com/  \nYahoo Search\n\n  [3]: http://search.msn.com/    \nMSN Search\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the implicit link name shortcut, you could instead write:\n\n\nI get 10 times more traffic from [Google][] than from\n[Yahoo][] or [MSN][].\n\n  [google]: http://google.com/        \nGoogle\n\n  [yahoo]:  http://search.yahoo.com/  \nYahoo Search\n\n  [msn]:    http://search.msn.com/    \nMSN Search\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth of the above examples will produce the following HTML output:\n\n\np\nI get 10 times more traffic from \na href=\nhttp://google.com/\n\ntitle=\nGoogle\nGoogle\n/a\n than from\n\na href=\nhttp://search.yahoo.com/\n title=\nYahoo Search\nYahoo\n/a\n\nor \na href=\nhttp://search.msn.com/\n title=\nMSN Search\nMSN\n/a\n.\n/p\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor comparison, here is the same paragraph written using Markdown\ns inline link style:\n\n\nI get 10 times more traffic from [Google](http://google.com/ \nGoogle\n)\nthan from [Yahoo](http://search.yahoo.com/ \nYahoo Search\n) or\n[MSN](http://search.msn.com/ \nMSN Search\n).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe point of reference-style links is not that they\nre easier to write. The point is that with reference-style links, your document source is vastly more readable. Compare the above examples: using reference-style links, the paragraph itself is only 81 characters long; with inline-style links, it\ns 176 characters; and as raw HTML, it\ns 234 characters. In the raw HTML, there\ns more markup than there is text.\n\n\nWith Markdown\ns reference-style links, a source document much more closely resembles the final output, as rendered in a browser. By allowing you to move the markup-related metadata out of the paragraph, you can add links without interrupting the narrative flow of your prose.\n\n\nEmphasis\n\n\nMarkdown treats asterisks (\n*\n) and underscores (\n_\n) as indicators of emphasis. Text wrapped with one \n*\n or \n_\n will be wrapped with an HTML \nem\n tag; double \n*\ns or \n_\ns will be wrapped with an HTML \nstrong\n tag. E.g., this input:\n\n\n*single asterisks*\n\n_single underscores_\n\n**double asterisks**\n\n__double underscores__\n\n\n\n\n\nwill produce:\n\n\nem\nsingle asterisks\n/em\n\n\n\nem\nsingle underscores\n/em\n\n\n\nstrong\ndouble asterisks\n/strong\n\n\n\nstrong\ndouble underscores\n/strong\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use whichever style you prefer; the lone restriction is that the same character must be used to open and close an emphasis span.\n\n\nEmphasis can be used in the middle of a word:\n\n\nun*frigging*believable\n\n\n\n\n\nBut if you surround an \n*\n or \n_\n with spaces, it\nll be treated as a literal asterisk or underscore.\n\n\nTo produce a literal asterisk or underscore at a position where it would otherwise be used as an emphasis delimiter, you can backslash escape it:\n\n\n\\*this text is surrounded by literal asterisks\\*\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\nTo indicate a span of code, wrap it with backtick quotes (\n`\n). Unlike a pre-formatted code block, a code span indicates code within a normal paragraph. For example:\n\n\nUse the `printf()` function.\n\n\n\n\n\nwill produce:\n\n\np\nUse the \ncode\nprintf()\n/code\n function.\n/p\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo include a literal backtick character within a code span, you can use multiple backticks as the opening and closing delimiters:\n\n\n``There is a literal backtick (`) here.``\n\n\n\n\n\nwhich will produce this:\n\n\np\ncode\nThere is a literal backtick (`) here.\n/code\n/p\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe backtick delimiters surrounding a code span may include spaces \n one after the opening, one before the closing. This allows you to place literal backtick characters at the beginning or end of a code span:\n\n\nA single backtick in a code span: `` ` ``\n\nA backtick-delimited string in a code span: `` `foo` ``\n\n\n\n\n\nwill produce:\n\n\np\nA single backtick in a code span: \ncode\n`\n/code\n/p\n\n\n\np\nA backtick-delimited string in a code span: \ncode\n`foo`\n/code\n/p\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith a code span, ampersands and angle brackets are encoded as HTML entities automatically, which makes it easy to include example HTML tags. Markdown will turn this:\n\n\nPlease don\nt use any `\nblink\n` tags.\n\n\n\n\n\ninto:\n\n\np\nPlease don\nt use any \ncode\nlt;blink\ngt;\n/code\n tags.\n/p\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can write this:\n\n\n`\n#8212;` is the decimal-encoded equivalent of `\nmdash;`.\n\n\n\n\n\nto produce:\n\n\np\ncode\namp;#8212;\n/code\n is the decimal-encoded\nequivalent of \ncode\namp;mdash;\n/code\n.\n/p\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImages\n\n\nAdmittedly, it\ns fairly difficult to devise a \nnatural\n syntax for placing images into a plain text document format.\n\n\nMarkdown uses an image syntax that is intended to resemble the syntax for links, allowing for two styles: \ninline\n and \nreference\n.\n\n\nInline image syntax looks like this:\n\n\n![Alt text](/path/to/img.jpg)\n\n![Alt text](/path/to/img.jpg \nOptional title\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nThat is:\n\n\n\n\nAn exclamation mark: \n!\n;\n\n\nfollowed by a set of square brackets, containing the \nalt\n attribute text for the image;\n\n\nfollowed by a set of parentheses, containing the URL or path to the image, and an optional \ntitle\n attribute enclosed in double or single quotes.\n\n\n\n\nReference-style image syntax looks like this:\n\n\n![Alt text][id]\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere \nid\n is the name of a defined image reference. Image references are defined using syntax identical to link references:\n\n\n[id]: url/to/image  \nOptional title attribute\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs of this writing, Markdown has no syntax for specifying the dimensions of an image; if this is important to you, you can simply use regular HTML \nimg\n tags.\n\n\n\n\nMiscellaneous\n\n\nAutomatic Links\n\n\nMarkdown supports a shortcut style for creating \nautomatic\n links for URLs and email addresses: simply surround the URL or email address with angle brackets. What this means is that if you want to show the actual text of a URL or email address, and also have it be a clickable link, you can do this:\n\n\nhttp://example.com/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarkdown will turn this into:\n\n\na href=\nhttp://example.com/\nhttp://example.com/\n/a\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutomatic links for email addresses work similarly, except that Markdown will also perform a bit of randomized decimal and hex entity-encoding to help obscure your address from address-harvesting spambots. For example, Markdown will turn this:\n\n\naddress@example.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninto something like this:\n\n\na href=\n#x6D;\n#x61;i\n#x6C;\n#x74;\n#x6F;:\n#x61;\n#x64;\n#x64;\n#x72;\n#x65;\n\n#115;\n#115;\n#64;\n#101;\n#120;\n#x61;\n#109;\n#x70;\n#x6C;e\n#x2E;\n#99;\n#111;\n\n#109;\n#x61;\n#x64;\n#x64;\n#x72;\n#x65;\n#115;\n#115;\n#64;\n#101;\n#120;\n#x61;\n\n#109;\n#x70;\n#x6C;e\n#x2E;\n#99;\n#111;\n#109;\n/a\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhich will render in a browser as a clickable link to \naddress@example.com\n.\n\n\n(This sort of entity-encoding trick will indeed fool many, if not most, address-harvesting bots, but it definitely won\nt fool all of them. It\ns better than nothing, but an address published in this way will probably eventually start receiving spam.)\n\n\nBackslash Escapes\n\n\nMarkdown allows you to use backslash escapes to generate literal characters which would otherwise have special meaning in Markdown\ns formatting syntax. For example, if you wanted to surround a word with literal asterisks (instead of an HTML \nem\n tag), you can use backslashes before the asterisks, like this:\n\n\n\\*literal asterisks\\*\n\n\n\n\n\nMarkdown provides backslash escapes for the following characters:\n\n\n\\   backslash\n`   backtick\n*   asterisk\n_   underscore\n{}  curly braces\n[]  square brackets\n()  parentheses\n#   hash mark\n+   plus sign\n-   minus sign (hyphen)\n.   dot\n!   exclamation mark",

A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While Markdown s syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters   including  Setext ,  atx ,  Textile ,  reStructuredText ,  Grutatext , and  EtText    the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown s syntax is the format of plain text email.  To this end, Markdown s syntax is comprised entirely of punctuation characters, which punctuation characters have been carefully chosen so as to look like what they mean. E.g., asterisks around a word actually look like *emphasis*. Markdown lists look like, well, lists. Even blockquotes look like quoted passages of text, assuming you ve ever used email.",

Its syntax is very small, corresponding only to a very small subset of HTML tags. The idea is  not  to create a syntax that makes it easier to insert HTML tags. In my opinion, HTML tags are already easy to insert. The idea for Markdown is to make it easy to read, write, and edit prose. HTML is a  publishing  format; Markdown is a  writing  format. Thus, Markdown s formatting syntax only addresses issues that can be conveyed in plain text.  For any markup that is not covered by Markdown s syntax, you simply use HTML itself. There s no need to preface it or delimit it to indicate that you re switching from Markdown to HTML; you just use the tags.  The only restrictions are that block-level HTML elements   e.g.  div ,  table ,  pre ,  p , etc.   must be separated from surrounding content by blank lines, and the start and end tags of the block should not be indented with tabs or spaces. Markdown is smart enough not to add extra (unwanted)  p  tags around HTML block-level tags.  For example, to add an HTML table to a Markdown article:  This is a regular paragraph. table \n     tr \n         td Foo /td \n     /tr  /table \n\nThis is another regular paragraph.  Note that Markdown formatting syntax is not processed within block-level HTML tags. E.g., you can t use Markdown-style  *emphasis*  inside an HTML block.  Span-level HTML tags   e.g.  span ,  cite , or  del    can be used anywhere in a Markdown paragraph, list item, or header. If you want, you can even use HTML tags instead of Markdown formatting; e.g. if you d prefer to use HTML  a  or  img  tags instead of Markdown s link or image syntax, go right ahead.

If you want to use them as literal characters, you must escape them as entities, e.g.  lt; , and  amp; .  Ampersands in particular are bedeviling for web writers. If you want to write about  AT T , you need to write  AT amp;T . You even need to escape ampersands within URLs. Thus, if you want to link to:  http://images.google.com/images?num=30 q=larry+bird  you need to encode the URL as:  http://images.google.com/images?num=30 amp;q=larry+bird  in your anchor tag  href  attribute. Needless to say, this is easy to forget, and is probably the single most common source of HTML validation errors in otherwise well-marked-up web sites.  Markdown allows you to use these characters naturally, taking care of all the necessary escaping for you. If you use an ampersand as part of an HTML entity, it remains unchanged; otherwise it will be translated into  amp; .  So, if you want to include a copyright symbol in your article, you can write:  copy;  and Markdown will leave it alone. But if you write:  AT T  Markdown will translate it to:  AT amp;T  Similarly, because Markdown supports  inline HTML , if you use angle brackets as delimiters for HTML tags, Markdown will treat them as such. But if you write:  4   5  Markdown will translate it to:  4  lt; 5  However, inside Markdown code spans and blocks, angle brackets and ampersands are  always  encoded automatically. This makes it easy to use Markdown to write about HTML code.

The HTML Markdown produces from the above list is:  ol  li Bird /li  li McHale /li  li Parish /li  /ol   If you instead wrote the list in Markdown like this:  1.  Bird\n1.  McHale\n1.  Parish  or even:  3. Bird\n1. McHale\n8. Parish  you d get the exact same HTML output. The point is, if you want to, you can use ordinal numbers in your ordered Markdown lists, so that the numbers in your source match the numbers in your published HTML. But if you want to be lazy, you don t have to.  If you do use lazy list numbering, however, you should still start the list with the number 1. At some point in the future, Markdown may support starting ordered lists at an arbitrary number.  List markers typically start at the left margin, but may be indented by up to three spaces. List markers must be followed by one or more spaces or a tab.  To make lists look nice, you can wrap items with hanging indents:  *   Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus. Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus.\n*   Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit.

Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.  If list items are separated by blank lines, Markdown will wrap the \nitems in  p  tags in the HTML output. For example, this input:  *   Bird\n*   Magic  will turn into:  ul  li Bird /li  li Magic /li  /ul   But this:  *   Bird\n\n*   Magic  will turn into:  ul  li p Bird /p /li  li p Magic /p /li  /ul   List items may consist of multiple paragraphs. Each subsequent paragraph in a list item must be indented by either 4 spaces or one tab:  1.  This is a list item with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus.\n\n    Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus. Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit.\n\n2.  Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.  It looks nice if you indent every line of the subsequent paragraphs, but here again, Markdown will allow you to be lazy:  *   This is a list item with two paragraphs.\n\n    This is the second paragraph in the list item.

            "text": "Pre-formatted code blocks are used for writing about programming or markup source code. Rather than forming normal paragraphs, the lines of a code block are interpreted literally. Markdown wraps a code block in both  pre  and  code  tags.  To produce a code block in Markdown, simply indent every line of the block by at least 4 spaces or 1 tab. For example, given this input:  This is a normal paragraph:\n\n    This is a code block.  Markdown will generate:  p This is a normal paragraph: /p  pre code This is a code block. /code /pre   One level of indentation   4 spaces or 1 tab   is removed from each line of the code block. For example, this:  Here is an example of AppleScript:\n\n    tell application  Foo \n        beep\n    end tell  will turn into:  p Here is an example of AppleScript: /p  pre code tell application  Foo \n    beep\nend tell /code /pre   A code block continues until it reaches a line that is not indented (or the end of the article).  Within a code block, ampersands ( ) and angle brackets (  and  ) are automatically converted into HTML entities. This makes it very easy to include example HTML source code using Markdown   just paste it and indent it, and Markdown will handle the hassle of encoding the ampersands and angle brackets. For example, this:       div class= footer \n         copy; 2004 Foo Corporation\n     /div   will turn into:  pre code lt;div class= footer gt;\n     amp;copy; 2004 Foo Corporation lt;/div gt; /code /pre   Regular Markdown syntax is not processed within code blocks. E.g., asterisks are just literal asterisks within a code block. This means it s also easy to use Markdown to write about Markdown s own syntax.",

            "text": "Markdown supports two style of links:  inline  and  reference .  In both styles, the link text is delimited by [square brackets].  To create an inline link, use a set of regular parentheses immediately after the link text s closing square bracket. Inside the parentheses, put the URL where you want the link to point, along with an  optional  title for the link, surrounded in quotes. For example:  This is [an example](http://example.com/  Title ) inline link.\n\n[This link](http://example.net/) has no title attribute.  Will produce:  p This is  a href= http://example.com/  title= Title \nan example /a  inline link. /p  p a href= http://example.net/ This link /a  has no\ntitle attribute. /p   If you re referring to a local resource on the same server, you can use relative paths:  See my [About](/about/) page for details.  Reference-style links use a second set of square brackets, inside which you place a label of your choosing to identify the link:  This is [an example][id] reference-style link.  You can optionally use a space to separate the sets of brackets:  This is [an example] [id] reference-style link.  Then, anywhere in the document, you define your link label like this, on a line by itself:  [id]: http://example.com/   Optional Title Here   That is:   Square brackets containing the link identifier (optionally indented from the left margin using up to three spaces);  followed by a colon;  followed by one or more spaces (or tabs);  followed by the URL for the link;  optionally followed by a title attribute for the link, enclosed in double or single quotes, or enclosed in parentheses.   The following three link definitions are equivalent:  [foo]: http://example.com/   Optional Title Here \n[foo]: http://example.com/   Optional Title Here \n[foo]: http://example.com/  (Optional Title Here)  Note:  There is a known bug in Markdown.pl 1.0.1 which prevents single quotes from being used to delimit link titles.  The link URL may, optionally, be surrounded by angle brackets:  [id]:  http://example.com/    Optional Title Here   You can put the title attribute on the next line and use extra spaces or tabs for padding, which tends to look better with longer URLs:  [id]: http://example.com/longish/path/to/resource/here\n     Optional Title Here   Link definitions are only used for creating links during Markdown processing, and are stripped from your document in the HTML output.  Link definition names may consist of letters, numbers, spaces, and punctuation   but they are  not  case sensitive. E.g. these two links:  [link text][a]\n[link text][A]  are equivalent.  The  implicit link name  shortcut allows you to omit the name of the link, in which case the link text itself is used as the name. Just use an empty set of square brackets   e.g., to link the word  Google  to the google.com web site, you could simply write:  [Google][]  And then define the link:  [Google]: http://google.com/  Because link names may contain spaces, this shortcut even works for multiple words in the link text:  Visit [Daring Fireball][] for more information.  And then define the link:  [Daring Fireball]: http://daringfireball.net/  Link definitions can be placed anywhere in your Markdown document. I tend to put them immediately after each paragraph in which they re used, but if you want, you can put them all at the end of your document, sort of like footnotes.  Here s an example of reference links in action:  I get 10 times more traffic from [Google] [1] than from\n[Yahoo] [2] or [MSN] [3].\n\n  [1]: http://google.com/         Google \n  [2]: http://search.yahoo.com/   Yahoo Search \n  [3]: http://search.msn.com/     MSN Search   Using the implicit link name shortcut, you could instead write:  I get 10 times more traffic from [Google][] than from\n[Yahoo][] or [MSN][].\n\n  [google]: http://google.com/         Google \n  [yahoo]:  http://search.yahoo.com/   Yahoo Search \n  [msn]:    http://search.msn.com/     MSN Search   Both of the above examples will produce the following HTML output:  p I get 10 times more traffic from  a href= http://google.com/ \ntitle= Google Google /a  than from a href= http://search.yahoo.com/  title= Yahoo Search Yahoo /a \nor  a href= http://search.msn.com/  title= MSN Search MSN /a . /p   For comparison, here is the same paragraph written using Markdown s inline link style:  I get 10 times more traffic from [Google](http://google.com/  Google )\nthan from [Yahoo](http://search.yahoo.com/  Yahoo Search ) or\n[MSN](http://search.msn.com/  MSN Search ).  The point of reference-style links is not that they re easier to write. The point is that with reference-style links, your document source is vastly more readable. Compare the above examples: using reference-style links, the paragraph itself is only 81 characters long; with inline-style links, it s 176 characters; and as raw HTML, it s 234 characters. In the raw HTML, there s more markup than there is text.  With Markdown s reference-style links, a source document much more closely resembles the final output, as rendered in a browser. By allowing you to move the markup-related metadata out of the paragraph, you can add links without interrupting the narrative flow of your prose.",

            "text": "General Usage\n\n\nUsing PyMdown.\n\n\n\n\nUsing PyMdown\n\n\nPyMdown was written to aid in batch processing Markdown files with Python Markdown and Pygments (but a JavaScript highlighter can just as easily be used).  It also adds a number of optional extensions.\n\n\nPyMdown can also optionally use a template with CSS and JavaScript for styling the Markdown outputs.  Templates, CSS, JavaScript, and extensions are all setup in a configuration file.  If for certain batches specific settings need to be tweaked, PyMdown can accept paths to specific settings file via the CLI.  The settings files is in the YAML format.  PyMdown also supports input sources with a YAML frontmatter where settings can be configured along with general meta data.\n\n\nThough PyMdown could be used to generate a site, it was mainly designed to generate static documents from Markdown for general use or previewing.  If you are looking to generate document sites, there are plenty of good tools that already do this (\nmkdocs\n is one suggestion).  But even if you don\nt directly use PyMdown, you may still find the \nPyMdown extensions\n as useful additions in other Python Markdown related projects as they can be installed and used independently.\n\n\nCommand Line Interface\n\n\nInput Files\n\n\nIn its most basic usage, PyMdown accepts a markdown file:\n\n\npymdown file.md\n\n\n\n\n\nor a file stream:\n\n\npymdown \n file.md\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecifying Output\n\n\nPyMdown allows the output to be specified with the \n--output\n or \n-o\n option:\n\n\npymdown -o file.html file.md\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively you can redirect the output:\n\n\npymdown -o file.md \n file.html\n\n\n\n\n\nBatch Processing\n\n\nPyMdown has a batch processing mode (\n--batch\n or \n-b\n). When the batch flag is set, PyMdown will accept multiple paths and wild-card patterns.\n\n\npymdown -b *.md documents/*md\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen in batch mode, PyMdown will simply transform the input file name: \nfile.md\n -\n \nfile.html\n. It will then save the output file in the same location as the input.\n\n\nPreviewing Markdown\n\n\nWith the \n--preview\n or \n-p\n option, PyMdown will generate a temp HTML file and open it in the default web browser.  Preview mode will work in normal and batch mode.\n\n\npymdown -p file.md\n\n\n\n\n\nBasepath\n\n\nPyMdown in various circumstances (particularly in conjunction with specific PyMdown extensions) will try and resolve image, CSS, and JS asset paths for previews, base64 encoding, and other scenarios.  In order for this to work, a base path may be required and can be specified using the \n--basepath\n option.  If no base path is given, the base path will be that of the source file or \nNone\n if the source is a file stream.\n\n\npymdown --basepath ../assets file.md\n\n\n\n\n\nRelpath\n\n\nPyMdown in various circumstances (particularly in conjunction with specific PyMdown extensions) will try to create relative paths to assets or sources such as images, CSS, and JS.  In order for this to work, a relative path is needed.  The \n--relpath\n option is used to set this.  If \n--relpath\n is not set, it defaults to the output directory.  If the output directory is also not set (when output is dumped to stdout), the relative path will not be set.\n\n\npymdown --relpath ../somedirectory file.md\n\n\n\n\n\nSettings\n\n\nPyMdown will normally look in the location of the \nconfiguration directory\n to find the settings file, but the filename and path can be redirected with the \n--settings\n or \n-s\n option.\n\n\npymdown -s ../my_settings.yml file.md\n\n\n\n\n\nEncoding\n\n\nPyMdown can be configured to read the Markdown file(s) with a different encoding than the default \nUTF-8\n.  This is done with the \n--encoding\n or \n-e\n option.\n\n\npymdown -e utf-8 file.md\n\n\n\n\n\nBy default, the output encoding will be the same as the input, but if greater control is needed, the user can set the output encoding via the \n--output_encoding\n or \n-E\n option.\n\n\npymdown -E utf-8 file.md\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle\n\n\nPyMdown, by default, will use the source file\ns name as the title, or if the input is a file stream, it will use \nUntitled\n.  But this can be set/overridden with the \n--title\n option.  This probably isn\nt practical for batch processing.  When batch processing, it may make more sense to utilize the \nfrontmatter\n to set the title per file.\n\n\npymdown --title \nMy Awesome File\n file.md\n\n\n\n\n\nCritic\n\n\nPyMdown has a couple options from CriticMarkup.  By using the \n--accept\n or \n-a\n option, when the Markdown is parsed, the suggested changes will be accepted.\n\n\nWhen using the \n--reject\n or \n-r\n option when Markdown is parsed, the suggested changes will be rejected and the original content will be used instead.\n\n\nIf both \n--accept\n and \n--reject\n are set at the same time, PyMdown will use the view mode and convert the file to HTML and will attempt to highlight the blocks targeted with the CriticMarkup.\n\n\nLastly, the \n--critic-dump\n option, when used with either the \n--accept\n or \n--reject\n option, will take the source and output it accepting or rejecting respectively the CriticMarkup edits that were made (essentially removing the CriticMarkup from the file).\n\n\nPlain HTML\n\n\nIf a stripped down HTML output is preferred, the \n--plain-html\n or \n-P\n option will return a stripped down output with no templates, no HTML comments, and no id, style, class, or on* attributes.\n\n\npymdown -P file.md\n\n\n\n\n\nForce No Template\n\n\nIf by default the configuration file has defined a template, but it is desired to do an output without the template, the \n--force-no-template\n option can be used to disable template use.\n\n\npymdown --force-no-template file.md\n\n\n\n\n\nForce Stdout\n\n\nSometimes a file may have frontmatter that redirects its output to a file, but it may be desirable to send the output to stdout.  In this case, the \n--force-stdout\n option can be used to force a redirect to stdout.\n\n\npymdown --force-stdout file.md\n\n\n\n\n\nQuiet\n\n\nIn some situations it may be desired to hide error messages and general info from the stdout.  In this case, the \n--quiet\n or \n-q\n option may be used.\n\n\npymdown -q file.md\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration File\n\n\nThe configuration file is used to specify general Python Markdown settings, optional template, CSS and JS resources for templates, and extensions that will be used.\n\n\nPyMdown on the first run will unpack user files to \n~\\.PyMdown\n on Windows, \n~/.PyMdown\n on OSX and \n~/.config/PyMdown\n on Linux.  The global configuration file can found here at the root of the folder along with default CSS, JavaScript, and other resources which would be under another sub-folder called \ndefault\n.  Files under \ndefault\n will be auto-upgraded when necessary by newer versions of PyMdown and should be left unaltered.  Default files can be copied and altered outside of the \ndefault\n location for personal tweaking and usage.\n\n\nPython Markdown Settings\n\n\nPython Markdown has a number of settings that can be configured:\n\n\n# Length of tabs in source files\n\n\ntab_length\n:\n \n4\n\n\n\n# Ignore number of first item in ordered list.\n\n\n# Setting this to false will force the list to start with the\n\n\n# first specified number in the list.\n\n\nlazy_ol\n:\n \ntrue\n\n\n\n# Python Markdown by default enables smart logic for _connected_words_\n\n\n# but only on italic with the underscore character.  I find this behavior odd\n\n\n# and disable it by default for a more traditional markdown feel by default.\n\n\n# Extensions can override this.\n\n\nsmart_emphasis\n:\n \nfalse\n\n\n\n# Enable/disable attributes\n\n\nenable_attributes\n:\n \ntrue\n\n\n\n# Output format (html|html5|html5|xhtml|xhtml1|xhtml5)\n\n\n# It is recommend to use more specific versions such as: html5 or xhtml1 than\n\n\n# general html or xhtml\n\n\noutput_format\n:\n \nxhtml1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSafe mode setting is omitted as it is pending deprecation in Python Markdown.\n\n\nPygment Settings\n\n\nThe following setting determines if a one of the installed Pygments CSS themes will be injected into your template.  This can be turned off if you are applying your own, or you are configured to use a JavaScript syntax highlighter.\n\n\n# Include the pygments css when using codehilite extension\n\n\nuse_pygments_css\n:\n \ntrue,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf any of the following reasons are true, Pygments CSS will not be injected regardless of whether \nuse_pygments_css\n is enabled or not:\n\n\n- CodeHilite and/or InlineHilite extension are not being used.\n- CodeHilite and/or InlineHilite have `use_pygments` set to `False` or `noclasses` set to `True`.\n- Pygments is not installed on the system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis setting is used to configure which installed Pygments theme PyMdown should insert into your HTML template.\n\n\n# Name of installed Pygments style to use.\n\n\npygments_style\n:\n \ndefault\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis determines what class will be prepended to all of the Pygment\ns CSS theme.\n\n\n# Pygments class to use.  This applies a class to the Pygments CSS\n\n\n# so that only elements with the class below will be syntax highlighted.\n\n\n# If using this, make sure you\nve configured CodeHilite and/or InlineHilite\n\n\n# to use the same name.\n\n\npygments_class\n:\n \nhighlight\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\nIf you want to use a JavaScript highlighter such as \nhighlight.js\n, you should disable \nuse_pygments_css\n, and set \nuse_pygments\n to \nFalse\n in CodeHilite and/or InlineHilite.\n\n\n\n\nTemplate\n\n\nPyMdown allows for specifying a simple HTML template that can be used for the output.  Template files can be specified in the settings file via the \ntemplate\n keyword.\n\n\n# Your HTML template\n\n\n# PyMdown will look relative to the binary if it can\nt find the file.\n\n\ntemplate\n:\n \ndefault/template.html\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTemplate files in the settings or frontmatter can be followed by \n;encoding\n to cause the file to be opened and read with the specified encoding.\n\n\nThe template file uses Jinja2 to handle template variables.  Please see \nTemplating\n for more info on how to access page data in a template.\n\n\nJavascript and CSS\n\n\nJavascript and CSS can be included in the template by adding them to the following arrays:\n\n\n# Select your CSS for you output html\n\n\n# or you can have it all contained in your HTML template\n\n\n#\n\n\n# Is an array of stylesheets (path or link).\n\n\n# If it points to a physical file, it will be included.\n\n\n# PyMdown will look relative to the binary if it can\nt find the file.\n\n\n#\n\n\n# This can be overridden in a file\ns frontmatter via the \nsettings\n key word:\n\n\n#\n\n\n# ---\n\n\n# settings:\n\n\n#   css:\n\n\n#     - somefile.css\n\n\n# ---\n\n\n#\n\n\n# but if you want to append to the list, you can use just the \ncss\n keyword in the\n\n\n# frontmatter:\n\n\n#\n\n\n# ---\n\n\n# css:\n\n\n#   - somefile.css\n\n\n# ---\n\n\n#\n\n\ncss\n:\n\n\n-\n \n^default/markdown.css\n\n\n\n# Load up js scripts (in head)\n\n\n#\n\n\n# Is an array of scripts (path or link).\n\n\n# If it points to a physical file, it will be included.\n\n\n# PyMdown will look relative to the binary if it can\nt find the file.\n\n\n#\n\n\n# This can be overridden in a file\ns frontmatter via the \nsettings\n key word:\n\n\n#\n\n\n# ---\n\n\n# settings:\n\n\n#   js:\n\n\n#     - somefile.js\n\n\n# ---\n\n\n#\n\n\n# but if you want to append to the list, you can use just the \njs\n keyword in the\n\n\n# frontmatter:\n\n\n#\n\n\n# ---\n\n\n# js:\n\n\n#   - somefile.js\n\n\n# ---\n\n\n#\n\n\njs\n:\n \n[]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCSS files and JavaScript files can be URLs or file paths.  When specifying a file path, a \n!\n can be used to precede the path so that PyMdown will just link the file and skip converting the file to an absolute or relative path.  If the file path is preceded by a \n^\n, the file content will be embedded in the HTML under a style or script tag depending on the source type.\n\n\nCSS and JavaScript files can also be followed by \n;encoding\n to read in the file with the specified encoding.\n\n\nEnabling Jinja2 Templating in Markdown Content\n\n\nIf desired, Jinja2 templating can be enabled in Markdown content.  While Jinja2 usage in Markdown content can be enabled globally, it is recommended to enable it in specific pages via the YAML frontmatter.\n\n\n# Enable Jinja2 Template support inside of Markdown content\n\n\nuse_jinja2\n:\n \nfalse\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also control the tag style if you find the default difficult to use within your content either globally in your settings file, or in your page\ns YAML frontmatter.\n\n\n# By default, Jinja2 uses {% block %} for blocks. You can change that here\n\n\n# or change it per file in your frontmatter. Only affects Markdown content template tags.\n\n\njinja2_block\n:\n \n[\n{%\n,\n \n%}\n]\n\n\n\n# By default, Jinja2 uses {{ variable }} for variables. You can change that here\n\n\n# or change it per file in your frontmatter. Only affects Markdown content template tags.\n\n\njinja2_variable\n:\n \n[\n{{\n,\n \n}}\n]\n\n\n\n# By default, Jinja2 uses {# comment #} for comments. You can change that here\n\n\n# or change it per file in your frontmatter. Only affects Markdown content template tags.\n\n\njinja2_comment\n:\n \n[\n{#\n,\n \n#}\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee \nTemplating\n to learn more about accessing these template variables.\n\n\nPath Conversions\n\n\nBy default, PyMdown converts paths to be relative to the output location.  If desired, this can be changed to an absolute path:\n\n\n# By default resource paths are converted to relative file paths when possible;\n\n\n# this disables conversion.\n\n\npath_conversion_absolute\n:\n \nfalse\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf path conversion is not wanted, and disabling the conversion inline with the \n!\n token is not acceptable, path conversion can be completely disabled with the following setting:\n\n\n# By default resource paths are converted to relative file paths when possible;\n\n\n# this disables conversion.  Previews will still convert paths to render preview proper.\n\n\ndisable_path_conversion\n:\n \nfalse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nPyMdown utilizes the \npathconverter\n extension to convert links and references in the actual markdown content.  If \npathconverter\n is manually configured instead of letting PyMdown handle it, these settings will have no effect.\n\n\nThe other exception is with previews.  In order for links and references to work in previews, they must be paths that are relative to the preview\ns temp directory or they must be absolute paths.  For this reason, PyMdown will always enable path conversions for previews.  If you have manually set up the \npathconverter\n extension, preview\ns will overwrite the \nrelative_path\n argument to ensure it is set to \n${OUTPUT}\n which will allow the preview to display content properly by making asset paths relative to the previews location.  By default, the \nrelative_path\n is set to \n${REL_PATH}\n which is the output path by default, but can be altered via the command line option \n--relpath\n or the \nrelpath\n frontmatter option.\n\n\n\n\nPython Markdown Extensions\n\n\nExtensions to be used are defined under the \nmarkdown_extensions\n keyword.  \nmarkdown_extensions\n is an ordered key/value pair. An extension has a name followed by \n:\n in yaml format.  If you want to include settings parameters, you can include those as the extension value.  All parameters should be done as key/value pairs as shown below.\n\n\nmarkdown_extensions\n:\n\n  \nmarkdown.extensions.extra\n:\n\n  \nmarkdown.extensions.toc\n:\n\n    \ntitle\n:\n \nTable of Contents\n\n    \nslugify\n:\n \n${SLUGIFY}\n\n  \nmarkdown.extensions.codehilite\n:\n\n    \nguess_lang\n:\n \nfalse\n\n  \nmarkdown.extensions.smarty\n:\n\n  \nmarkdown.extensions.wikilinks\n:\n\n  \nmarkdown.extensions.admonition\n:\n\n  \nmarkdown.extensions.nl2br\n:\n\n  \npymdown.pymdown\n:\n\n  \npymdown.b64\n:\n\n    \nbase_path\n:\n \n${BASE_PATH}\n\n  \npymdown.critic\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are a couple of special variables you can use in extension settings:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n${BASE_PATH}\n\n\nInsert the base path from command line or frontmatter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n${REL_PATH}\n\n\nInsert the relative path from command line or frontmatter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n${OUTPUT}\n\n\nInsert the output path (or destination) from command line or frontmatter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n${SLUGIFY}\n\n\nUse PyMdown\ns internal slugify method which provides a more unique header id for headers that have Unicode characters.  Python Markdown\ns internal slugify just strips them out, while PyMdown will give a percent encoding of the Unicode characters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrontmatter\n\n\nFrontmatter can be used at the very beginning of a Markdown file.  Frontmatter blocks begin with \n---\n and end with \n---\n.  Frontmatter must be the very beginning of the file and start on the very first line.\n\n\nPyMdown frontmatter content must be in the YAML format.  The frontmatter is a dictionary of key value pairs which will either be available in templates and/or used to set some functionality or setting per page.\n\n\n---\ntitle: My Title\nauthor: My Name\netc: You get the idea\n---\n### Markdown Header\nMarkdown content.\n\n\n\n\n\nPyMdown has a few special keywords that can be defined to alter the output.  All other keys will be counted as user variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeyword\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntitle\n\n\nThis item is used in the HTML\ns title tag.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndestination\n\n\nThis keyword is the location and file name were the output should be placed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbasepath\n\n\nThis is used to specify the path that PyMdown should use to look for reference material like CSS or JS files and even \nreferences\n defined in the frontmatter. It is also used in plugins such as \npathconverter\n and \nb64\n.  This can override the \nbasepath\n fed in at the command line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrelpath\n\n\nThis is used to specify the path that images and paths are relative to. It is used in plugins such as \npathconverter\n.  This can override the \nrelpath\n fed in at the command line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncss\n\n\nThis keyword\ns value is an array of strings denoting additional single CSS files to include.  They follow the same convention as CSS defined in the settings file: \n;encoding\n at tail will define the encoding used to access the file, paths starting with \n!\n will not have their path converted to absolute or relative paths, and \n^\n will directly embed the content in the HTML file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\njs\n\n\nThis keyword\ns value is an array of strings denoting additional single JavaScript files to include.  They follow the same convention as JavaScript defined in the settings file: \n;encoding\n at tail will define the encoding used to access the file, paths starting with \n!\n will not have their path converted to absolute or relative paths, and \n^\n will directly embed the content in the HTML file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsettings\n\n\nThis is a dictionary and allows the overriding of any of the settings found in the original configuration file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee \nTemplating\n to learn more about accessing these values in your HTML template.\n\n\nCustom Frontmatter\n\n\nIf the keyword is not one of the special keywords defined above, they will automatically be available in the template variables under \nextra\n\n\nTemplating\n\n\nTemplates are HTML files that use \nJinja2\n templating syntax.  Template variables and logic is used in the HTML templates.  If desired, Jinja2 templating can be enabled in the Markdown content by with the following syntax:\n\n\nsettings\n:\n\n  \nuse_jinja2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is up to the user to escape content that must be escaped. If desired, the brackets for a given page can be changed with the following frontmatter:\n\n\nsettings\n:\n\n  \njinja2_block\n:\n \n[\n{%\n,\n \n%}\n]\n\n  \njinja2_variable\n:\n \n[\n{{\n,\n \n}}\n]\n\n  \njinja2_comment\n:\n \n[\n{#\n,\n \n#}\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTemplate data is found under three variables:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npage\n\n\nData related to the specific page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nextra\n\n\nThis contains user defined variables.  These can come from the settings file under the \nextra\n keyword, or any non-default keyword found in the frontmatter. Extra can contain any content and structure the user specifies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsettings\n\n\nThis is the the settings used for the page.  It contains the merged state of the settings from the settings file and frontmatter.

File paths may contain special markers such as \n^\n and \n!\n at the beginning to specify to embed the content directly or not to convert path respectively. File paths may also include encoding specifiers at the end in the form \n;encoding\n. Special \ntemplate filters\n have been provided to process these files and links and return either the links or contents as intended. Returns will be wrapped in their appropriate tags.\n\n\n\n\n\n\npage.css\n\n\nAn array of CSS files or links that were specified to be include.  File paths may contain special markers such as \n^\n and \n!\n at the beginning to specify to embed the content directly or not to convert path respectively.

It also adds a number of optional extensions.  PyMdown can also optionally use a template with CSS and JavaScript for styling the Markdown outputs.  Templates, CSS, JavaScript, and extensions are all setup in a configuration file.  If for certain batches specific settings need to be tweaked, PyMdown can accept paths to specific settings file via the CLI.  The settings files is in the YAML format.  PyMdown also supports input sources with a YAML frontmatter where settings can be configured along with general meta data.  Though PyMdown could be used to generate a site, it was mainly designed to generate static documents from Markdown for general use or previewing.  If you are looking to generate document sites, there are plenty of good tools that already do this ( mkdocs  is one suggestion).  But even if you don t directly use PyMdown, you may still find the  PyMdown extensions  as useful additions in other Python Markdown related projects as they can be installed and used independently.",

            "text": "Input Files  In its most basic usage, PyMdown accepts a markdown file:  pymdown file.md  or a file stream:  pymdown   file.md  Specifying Output  PyMdown allows the output to be specified with the  --output  or  -o  option:  pymdown -o file.html file.md  Alternatively you can redirect the output:  pymdown -o file.md   file.html  Batch Processing  PyMdown has a batch processing mode ( --batch  or  -b ). When the batch flag is set, PyMdown will accept multiple paths and wild-card patterns.  pymdown -b *.md documents/*md  When in batch mode, PyMdown will simply transform the input file name:  file.md  -   file.html . It will then save the output file in the same location as the input.  Previewing Markdown  With the  --preview  or  -p  option, PyMdown will generate a temp HTML file and open it in the default web browser.  Preview mode will work in normal and batch mode.  pymdown -p file.md  Basepath  PyMdown in various circumstances (particularly in conjunction with specific PyMdown extensions) will try and resolve image, CSS, and JS asset paths for previews, base64 encoding, and other scenarios.  In order for this to work, a base path may be required and can be specified using the  --basepath  option.  If no base path is given, the base path will be that of the source file or  None  if the source is a file stream.  pymdown --basepath ../assets file.md  Relpath  PyMdown in various circumstances (particularly in conjunction with specific PyMdown extensions) will try to create relative paths to assets or sources such as images, CSS, and JS.  In order for this to work, a relative path is needed.  The  --relpath  option is used to set this.  If  --relpath  is not set, it defaults to the output directory.  If the output directory is also not set (when output is dumped to stdout), the relative path will not be set.  pymdown --relpath ../somedirectory file.md  Settings  PyMdown will normally look in the location of the  configuration directory  to find the settings file, but the filename and path can be redirected with the  --settings  or  -s  option.  pymdown -s ../my_settings.yml file.md  Encoding  PyMdown can be configured to read the Markdown file(s) with a different encoding than the default  UTF-8 .  This is done with the  --encoding  or  -e  option.  pymdown -e utf-8 file.md  By default, the output encoding will be the same as the input, but if greater control is needed, the user can set the output encoding via the  --output_encoding  or  -E  option.  pymdown -E utf-8 file.md  Title  PyMdown, by default, will use the source file s name as the title, or if the input is a file stream, it will use  Untitled .  But this can be set/overridden with the  --title  option.  This probably isn t practical for batch processing.  When batch processing, it may make more sense to utilize the  frontmatter  to set the title per file.  pymdown --title  My Awesome File  file.md  Critic  PyMdown has a couple options from CriticMarkup.  By using the  --accept  or  -a  option, when the Markdown is parsed, the suggested changes will be accepted.  When using the  --reject  or  -r  option when Markdown is parsed, the suggested changes will be rejected and the original content will be used instead.  If both  --accept  and  --reject  are set at the same time, PyMdown will use the view mode and convert the file to HTML and will attempt to highlight the blocks targeted with the CriticMarkup.  Lastly, the  --critic-dump  option, when used with either the  --accept  or  --reject  option, will take the source and output it accepting or rejecting respectively the CriticMarkup edits that were made (essentially removing the CriticMarkup from the file).  Plain HTML  If a stripped down HTML output is preferred, the  --plain-html  or  -P  option will return a stripped down output with no templates, no HTML comments, and no id, style, class, or on* attributes.  pymdown -P file.md  Force No Template  If by default the configuration file has defined a template, but it is desired to do an output without the template, the  --force-no-template  option can be used to disable template use.  pymdown --force-no-template file.md  Force Stdout  Sometimes a file may have frontmatter that redirects its output to a file, but it may be desirable to send the output to stdout.  In this case, the  --force-stdout  option can be used to force a redirect to stdout.  pymdown --force-stdout file.md  Quiet  In some situations it may be desired to hide error messages and general info from the stdout.  In this case, the  --quiet  or  -q  option may be used.  pymdown -q file.md",

PyMdown on the first run will unpack user files to  ~\\.PyMdown  on Windows,  ~/.PyMdown  on OSX and  ~/.config/PyMdown  on Linux.  The global configuration file can found here at the root of the folder along with default CSS, JavaScript, and other resources which would be under another sub-folder called  default .  Files under  default  will be auto-upgraded when necessary by newer versions of PyMdown and should be left unaltered.  Default files can be copied and altered outside of the  default  location for personal tweaking and usage.  Python Markdown Settings  Python Markdown has a number of settings that can be configured:  # Length of tabs in source files  tab_length :   4  # Ignore number of first item in ordered list.  # Setting this to false will force the list to start with the  # first specified number in the list.  lazy_ol :   true  # Python Markdown by default enables smart logic for _connected_words_  # but only on italic with the underscore character.  I find this behavior odd  # and disable it by default for a more traditional markdown feel by default.  # Extensions can override this.  smart_emphasis :   false  # Enable/disable attributes  enable_attributes :   true  # Output format (html|html5|html5|xhtml|xhtml1|xhtml5)  # It is recommend to use more specific versions such as: html5 or xhtml1 than  # general html or xhtml  output_format :   xhtml1   Safe mode setting is omitted as it is pending deprecation in Python Markdown.  Pygment Settings  The following setting determines if a one of the installed Pygments CSS themes will be injected into your template.  This can be turned off if you are applying your own, or you are configured to use a JavaScript syntax highlighter.  # Include the pygments css when using codehilite extension  use_pygments_css :   true,    Note  If any of the following reasons are true, Pygments CSS will not be injected regardless of whether  use_pygments_css  is enabled or not:  - CodeHilite and/or InlineHilite extension are not being used.\n- CodeHilite and/or InlineHilite have `use_pygments` set to `False` or `noclasses` set to `True`.\n- Pygments is not installed on the system.   This setting is used to configure which installed Pygments theme PyMdown should insert into your HTML template.  # Name of installed Pygments style to use.  pygments_style :   default   This determines what class will be prepended to all of the Pygment s CSS theme.  # Pygments class to use.  This applies a class to the Pygments CSS  # so that only elements with the class below will be syntax highlighted.  # If using this, make sure you ve configured CodeHilite and/or InlineHilite  # to use the same name.  pygments_class :   highlight    Tip  If you want to use a JavaScript highlighter such as  highlight.js , you should disable  use_pygments_css , and set  use_pygments  to  False  in CodeHilite and/or InlineHilite.   Template  PyMdown allows for specifying a simple HTML template that can be used for the output.  Template files can be specified in the settings file via the  template  keyword.  # Your HTML template  # PyMdown will look relative to the binary if it can t find the file.  template :   default/template.html   Template files in the settings or frontmatter can be followed by  ;encoding  to cause the file to be opened and read with the specified encoding.  The template file uses Jinja2 to handle template variables.  Please see  Templating  for more info on how to access page data in a template.  Javascript and CSS  Javascript and CSS can be included in the template by adding them to the following arrays:  # Select your CSS for you output html  # or you can have it all contained in your HTML template  #  # Is an array of stylesheets (path or link).  # If it points to a physical file, it will be included.  # PyMdown will look relative to the binary if it can t find the file.  #  # This can be overridden in a file s frontmatter via the  settings  key word:  #  # ---  # settings:  #   css:  #     - somefile.css  # ---  #  # but if you want to append to the list, you can use just the  css  keyword in the  # frontmatter:  #  # ---  # css:  #   - somefile.css  # ---  #  css :  -   ^default/markdown.css  # Load up js scripts (in head)  #  # Is an array of scripts (path or link).  # If it points to a physical file, it will be included.  # PyMdown will look relative to the binary if it can t find the file.  #  # This can be overridden in a file s frontmatter via the  settings  key word:  #  # ---  # settings:  #   js:  #     - somefile.js  # ---  #  # but if you want to append to the list, you can use just the  js  keyword in the  # frontmatter:  #  # ---  # js:  #   - somefile.js  # ---  #  js :   []   CSS files and JavaScript files can be URLs or file paths.  When specifying a file path, a  !  can be used to precede the path so that PyMdown will just link the file and skip converting the file to an absolute or relative path.  If the file path is preceded by a  ^ , the file content will be embedded in the HTML under a style or script tag depending on the source type.  CSS and JavaScript files can also be followed by  ;encoding  to read in the file with the specified encoding.  Enabling Jinja2 Templating in Markdown Content  If desired, Jinja2 templating can be enabled in Markdown content.  While Jinja2 usage in Markdown content can be enabled globally, it is recommended to enable it in specific pages via the YAML frontmatter.  # Enable Jinja2 Template support inside of Markdown content  use_jinja2 :   false   You can also control the tag style if you find the default difficult to use within your content either globally in your settings file, or in your page s YAML frontmatter.  # By default, Jinja2 uses {% block %} for blocks. You can change that here  # or change it per file in your frontmatter. Only affects Markdown content template tags.  jinja2_block :   [ {% ,   %} ]  # By default, Jinja2 uses {{ variable }} for variables. You can change that here  # or change it per file in your frontmatter. Only affects Markdown content template tags.  jinja2_variable :   [ {{ ,   }} ]  # By default, Jinja2 uses {# comment #} for comments. You can change that here  # or change it per file in your frontmatter. Only affects Markdown content template tags.  jinja2_comment :   [ {# ,   #} ]   See  Templating  to learn more about accessing these template variables.  Path Conversions  By default, PyMdown converts paths to be relative to the output location.  If desired, this can be changed to an absolute path:  # By default resource paths are converted to relative file paths when possible;  # this disables conversion.  path_conversion_absolute :   false   If path conversion is not wanted, and disabling the conversion inline with the  !  token is not acceptable, path conversion can be completely disabled with the following setting:  # By default resource paths are converted to relative file paths when possible;  # this disables conversion.  Previews will still convert paths to render preview proper.  disable_path_conversion :   false    Note  PyMdown utilizes the  pathconverter  extension to convert links and references in the actual markdown content.  If  pathconverter  is manually configured instead of letting PyMdown handle it, these settings will have no effect.  The other exception is with previews.  In order for links and references to work in previews, they must be paths that are relative to the preview s temp directory or they must be absolute paths.  For this reason, PyMdown will always enable path conversions for previews.  If you have manually set up the  pathconverter  extension, preview s will overwrite the  relative_path  argument to ensure it is set to  ${OUTPUT}  which will allow the preview to display content properly by making asset paths relative to the previews location.  By default, the  relative_path  is set to  ${REL_PATH}  which is the output path by default, but can be altered via the command line option  --relpath  or the  relpath  frontmatter option.   Python Markdown Extensions  Extensions to be used are defined under the  markdown_extensions  keyword.   markdown_extensions  is an ordered key/value pair. An extension has a name followed by  :  in yaml format.  If you want to include settings parameters, you can include those as the extension value.  All parameters should be done as key/value pairs as shown below.  markdown_extensions : \n   markdown.extensions.extra : \n   markdown.extensions.toc : \n     title :   Table of Contents \n     slugify :   ${SLUGIFY} \n   markdown.extensions.codehilite : \n     guess_lang :   false \n   markdown.extensions.smarty : \n   markdown.extensions.wikilinks : \n   markdown.extensions.admonition : \n   markdown.extensions.nl2br : \n   pymdown.pymdown : \n   pymdown.b64 : \n     base_path :   ${BASE_PATH} \n   pymdown.critic :   There are a couple of special variables you can use in extension settings:     Name  Description      ${BASE_PATH}  Insert the base path from command line or frontmatter.    ${REL_PATH}  Insert the relative path from command line or frontmatter.    ${OUTPUT}  Insert the output path (or destination) from command line or frontmatter.    ${SLUGIFY}  Use PyMdown s internal slugify method which provides a more unique header id for headers that have Unicode characters.

This extension runs before all other extensions to parse the critic edits.  It allows for the stripping or accepting of critic modifications and modifies the source to reflect the rejection or accepting of the edits (mark wrappers and comments are stripped in both cases).  It also allows for visually displaying the changes in HTML output (\nmileage may vary\n).\n\n\nOptions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption\n\n\nType\n\n\nDefault\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmode\n\n\nstring\n\n\nview\n\n\nview\n just parses the markup and displays it in its HTML equivalent rendering.  \naccept\n strips out the critic markup and replacing them with the suggested changes.  \nreject\n rejects all the suggestions and strips the critic markup out replacing it with the original.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLimitations with Previewing Critic Markup\n\n\nCriticMarkup, in general works very well.  Parsing the critic marks is very straight forward.  If you need to reject critic marks or accept them, the critic extension will work quite well.  But when trying to render the edits visually \nand\n trying to convert the document to HTML, things can get ugly.  I think this is really a design flaw with CriticMarkup.  The existence of the critic edits can alter the actual source.  Its a fantastic idea, but it should be understood that when using CriticMarkup beyond inline or block paragraphs, there is a possibility that invalid HTML will be created when viewing (especially in relation to lists or if breaking up Markdown syntax).  I think Fletcher said it best here: \nhttp://fletcher.github.io/MultiMarkdown-4/criticmarkup\n.\n\n\nThe critic extension does its best by employing a preprocessor to inject the critic tags before all other parsing and a post-processor to clean up some the weird side effects of the injection (only selected odd cases as others are more difficult to fix).  It injects some classes into the edit region\ns HTML output to allow for CSS styling to render them as well.  There is probably a lot more post-processing that could be done to fix more issues, but I am not yet sure how much further down that road I am willing to go.\n\n\nExamples\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarkup\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{--delete--}\n\n\ndelete\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{++delete++}\n\n\ninsert\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{~~delete and replace~\nsubstitutions~~}\n\n\ndelete and replace\nsubstitutions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{==highlight==}\n\n\nhighlight\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\ncomment\n}\n\n\ntext\ncomment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere they are in action:\n\n\nHere\n \nis\n \nsome\n \n{--*incorrect*--}\n \nMarkdown.\n  \nI\n \nam\n \nadding\n \nthis\n{++ here.++}\n.\n  \nHere\n \nis\n \nsome\n \nmore\n \n{--text\n\n\nthat I am removing--}\ntext.\n  \nAnd\n \nhere\n \nis\n \neven\n \nmore\n \n{++text that I\n\n\nam ++}\nadding.\n{~~\n\n\n\n~\n  ~~}\nParagraph\n \nwas\n \ndeleted\n \nand\n \nreplaced\n \nwith\n \nsome\n \nspaces.\n{~~  ~\n\n\n\n~~}\nSpaces\n \nwere\n \nremoved\n \nand\n \na\n \nparagraph\n \nwas\n \nadded.\n\nAnd\n \nhere\n \nis\n \na\n \ncomment\n \non\n \n{==some\n\n\n==text== ==}{\nThis works quite well.

If you need to reject critic marks or accept them, the critic extension will work quite well.  But when trying to render the edits visually  and  trying to convert the document to HTML, things can get ugly.  I think this is really a design flaw with CriticMarkup.  The existence of the critic edits can alter the actual source.  Its a fantastic idea, but it should be understood that when using CriticMarkup beyond inline or block paragraphs, there is a possibility that invalid HTML will be created when viewing (especially in relation to lists or if breaking up Markdown syntax).  I think Fletcher said it best here:  http://fletcher.github.io/MultiMarkdown-4/criticmarkup .  The critic extension does its best by employing a preprocessor to inject the critic tags before all other parsing and a post-processor to clean up some the weird side effects of the injection (only selected odd cases as others are more difficult to fix).  It injects some classes into the edit region s HTML output to allow for CSS styling to render them as well.  There is probably a lot more post-processing that could be done to fix more issues, but I am not yet sure how much further down that road I am willing to go.",

PathConverter takes a base path (an absolute path used as a reference for locating images and referenced files) and a relative path (an absolute path that the links will be relative to after conversion if not running in absolute mode) and then converts paths for the \nhref\n and/or \nsrc\n attributes in \na\n, \nscript\n, \nimg\n, and \nlink\n tags.\n\n\nPathConverter will only operate on file paths that can be confirmed to exist on the system it is run on.

The opening \n[\n can be followed by one or more \n=\n characters.

It can take percentages or fractions, and it can optionally generate classes for percentages at 20% levels.  It also works with Python Markdown s built in  attr_list  extension.  Though progress bars are rendered as block items, it accepts attr_list s inline format.  The basic syntax for progress bars is:  [=  percentage or fraction   optional single or double quoted title ] .  The opening  [  can be followed by one or more  =  characters. After the  =  char(s) the percentage is specified as either a fraction or percentage and can optionally be followed by a title surrounded in either double quotes or single quotes.",

If CodeHilite is not configured or installed, SuperFences will just escape in such a way that a JavaScript highlighter could be used.\n\n\nNested Fenced Blocks\n\n\nFenced blocks requires all nested fence content to be at least at the indentation levels of the fences (blank lines excluded).  The opening and closing fence markers must be indented at the same level.  If you are using a fenced block inside a blockquote, at least the first line of the fenced block needs to have the appropriate number of \n characters signifying the quote depth.\n\n\n ```\n  a fenced block\n  ```\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep in mind that too many blank lines will cause a blockquote to terminate, so remember to use \n markers accordingly if not marking every line.\n\n\n ```\n  a fenced block\n\n\n with blank lines\n  ```\n\n\n\n\n\nIf using a fenced block as the first line of a list, you will have to leave the first line blank, but remember that the list marker must be followed by a space.\n\n\n-\nspace\n\n    ```\n    a fenced block\n    ```\n\nDefinition\n:\nspace\n\n    ```\n    a fenced block\n    ```\n\n\n\n\n\nUML Diagrams\n\n\nWhen using the UML diagram features, you must provide the necessary JavaScript files for the HTML output.

            "text": "SuperFences provides 4 features:   The ability to nest fences under blockquotes, lists, or other block elements (this feature is provided as a workaround until a more official and better implementation is provided by the Python Markdown team; see  Limitations  for more info).  Special UML flowchart fence via the  flow  language specifier.  Special UML sequence diagram via the  sequence  language specifier.  The ability to disable indented code blocks in favor of only using the fenced variant (off by default).   All features can be turned on or off.  SuperFences relies on the  CodeHilite  extension for syntax highlighting, so CodeHilite is expected to be installed and configured if syntax highlighting desired.  If CodeHilite is not configured or installed, SuperFences will just escape in such a way that a JavaScript highlighter could be used.  Nested Fenced Blocks  Fenced blocks requires all nested fence content to be at least at the indentation levels of the fences (blank lines excluded).  The opening and closing fence markers must be indented at the same level.  If you are using a fenced block inside a blockquote, at least the first line of the fenced block needs to have the appropriate number of   characters signifying the quote depth.   ```\n  a fenced block\n  ```  Keep in mind that too many blank lines will cause a blockquote to terminate, so remember to use   markers accordingly if not marking every line.   ```\n  a fenced block  with blank lines\n  ```  If using a fenced block as the first line of a list, you will have to leave the first line blank, but remember that the list marker must be followed by a space.  - space \n    ```\n    a fenced block\n    ```\n\nDefinition\n: space \n    ```\n    a fenced block\n    ```  UML Diagrams  When using the UML diagram features, you must provide the necessary JavaScript files for the HTML output.
